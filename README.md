# Project CrickElite

## Overview
Project CrickElite aims to create the ultimate cricket team from a global pool of players. The selected team is designed to consistently score at least 180 runs on average and defend a score of 150 runs on average against any opponent. This project utilizes data analytics, machine learning, and optimization techniques to achieve this goal.

## Objectives
